# High Dimensional Data Analysis Project

This work, based on Chapter 5 "Encoding categorical predictors" of *Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models*
by Kuhn and Johnson, is a comprehensive analysis on how ordered and unordered categorical data can be encoded into a numerical form in order to be used by all types of models.\
Specifically this will touch both simple methods such as dummy encoding and more complex ones such as bayesian likelihood encoding. Finally, feature extraction techniques from textual data will also be introduced.

The final project, under the name of Progetto1_reprex basically in Markdown or PDF format, will touch 

"Images" folder contains the project's plots;\
"Datasets" contains all the datasets used;\
"Salvataggi" contains the results of the models trained in Chapter 5.7
